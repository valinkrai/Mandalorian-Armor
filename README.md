# Mandalorian-Armor
A collection of resources I used/made during the creation of my Mandalorian Armor.

Documentation on the build with many more pictures can be [on the Mando Mercs forums](https://mandalorianmercs.org/forum/index.php?topic=201635.0).

Where possible, I've included links to where I purchased supplies, these are mostly for my own reference, but feel free to use them as a guide for your own projects. Where I've purchased files, I'll try and link to where you can buy them, though I may not be able to share modifications on those files.

# Licenses
Each folder should have a readme with appropriate licenses, if you'd like to use them in a way that doesn't fit that, just contact me.

In most cases this will be either MIT for software or Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution:
