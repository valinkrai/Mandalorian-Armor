# Notes
This was designed for ingot given to me by a kid at Planet Comicon. It measures 74mm*138mm*7mm.

# Non model aspects
- The top clip is designed to be bent aluminum helt in by some small M3 screws+inserts.
- The other small holes are for 6mm depth m2.5 screws to hold top and bottom into sides
- The hole all the way through and partially through top and bottom is for a 2mm brass rod to align everything and keep the sides from rotating about the machine screws.
