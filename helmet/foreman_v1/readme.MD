# Visor Guide
for templating on a 8.5x11" visor, based on where I placed my T-nuts

# Arduino + Case
Case originally contained the arduino PWM fan controller. Code took a 5v (max) input signal from a potentiometer, then outputted PWM to transistors to control fans, which ran directly off of battery source.

# Keyslot
On my helmet, I just cut out a 40mm by 80mm hold for two 40mm Noctua fans. Since Alter Ego's helmet had come with a closed off keyslot file, I made my own with cut outs for airflow based on Boba's, I believe specifically the Black Series helmet.
