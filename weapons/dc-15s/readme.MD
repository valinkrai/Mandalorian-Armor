# Original Model
I did not make this, LigonAP did. However, this folder contains all the information I have on building it, including STLs for my mounts to the original, unmodidied blaster, which can be purchased at the link below from LigonAP.

This is definitely a work in progress to try and get the best sound and fit, but more less these work with some effort. 

While the original file recommends resin printing for the entire thing, I just did the smaller parts in resin, and did the main body, barrel, rear arm and arm mounts in PETG/FDM. The trigger, trigger mechanism, rear upper body and the cylindars in resin. The transparent light up bit I did in transparent blue Inland PETG from Microcenter

TODO:
Rear ammo LEDs
# Code
Tracks the amount of shots, and because this was written 3 days before a con, it just resets the arduino when reloading to avoid memory running out. Lots to fix.

# Included Custom Models
In order of barrel placement, from front to back. Each layers wires must be ran through the ones behind it.

- Center Light Assembly
    - These should be printed in twice, then attached together once the star base LEDs are placed inside. I further diffuse with some batting. Probably could be improved design wise.
- Speaker Assembly, I glued the speaker onto this, then placed behind the LED assembly
- ??
    - I'd have to check, but I believe I placed shims and the amplifier I used behind the speaker assembly. Maybe the SD card reader as well. Either way, you may need to shim this, or use extra long screws, which should protrude behind the back of the two assemblies.
- LED Assembly
    - To be friction fitted with 10mm LED, then placed at the very end of the barrel.
- Vibration assembly, the PS2 cibration motor is friction fitted inside this.
- Custom Holster
    - This is just a very simple holster to attack directly to the belt that tightly fits the DC-15s model.
