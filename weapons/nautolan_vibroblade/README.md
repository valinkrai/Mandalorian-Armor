# General notes
- This is designed to be used with aluminum bent to form the hand guard
- Machine screws I need to check the size of are used to hold the handle together.
- The blade was cut from a jigsaw from 1/4" poplar, but ideally would be laser cut. I sanding in the cutting edge, applied sanding sealer, then coats of poly, sanding to 600 grit, then airbrushed with a black undercoat, and a dust coat of spazstix chrome, and alclad aquagloss.
