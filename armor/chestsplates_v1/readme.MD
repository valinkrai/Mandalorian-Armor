# Template Instruction
Modify the illustrator file based on two key distances:
- Width: The distance between your arms/shoulder when arms are fully extended forward. This should match the width of all plates selected.
- Height: The distance from where your ab plate ends (around my belly button), and the inner center part of the neck, as close as you are comfortable with. This will not match the height of the entire file.

# Spacers
These are just to lock down 1/2" spacing, but could be modified as needed. Currently scaled for friction fit on 6mm sintra.
