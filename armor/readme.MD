# Armor
These folders contain various aspects of the the armor. The contents of this folder may change as I go through and organize/check attribution for other bits I don't have here.

While they are not here, my current backplate is based on Wizard of Flights template, as is my cod piece.

## Spacers
Just some basic spacers for the armor chest plates
