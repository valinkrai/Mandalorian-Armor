# handplate-vector-template
This is a custom made template for handplates for myself, designed to be used with 16 gauge aluminum.

# How-To
This was using 16 gauge aluminum cut with some basic tin snips. I drew the templates on with sharpie, along with the dotted bend lines. To bend, I first clamped between two pieces of corner angle iron, then heated with a MAP-Pro torch until the sharpie marks disappeared, then immediately bent with Needle nosed pliars and channel locks together. Do not touch the hot metal no matter what until cooled off, such as with water. Sand from  80-600 grit+ now to get the parts near raised areas. After this, I used a 24oz ballpeen hammer to clean up any bent or imperfect hedges, drilled 3/32 holes in each triangle point, then using 3/32 countersunk solid aluminum rivets, along with very careful manual countersinking with a countersinking drill bit, carefully testing with the rivets as I go until they are a hair raised above the surface. If desired, this may be a good time to attach snaps with rivets. Cut down the bottom of th rivet until it's about 1/4" to 1/2" raised. After this, turn over with the top of the handplate facing down, then hammer until the rivet is firmly attached, and smooth as possible. Sand the top triangle smooth, going from 80-600 grit or more as desired for effect. Paint and attach.
