# Model
Model is based off of [April Storm's v4 Custom Death Watch Gauntlet](https://www.etsy.com/listing/602469685/death-watch-bo-katan-pre-vizla-and). You'd need to ask her if you wanted my modified version of the model.

# Arduino Code
This is a more or less custom interface for my left gauntlet that uses button inputs and the like to modify what's on screen.
