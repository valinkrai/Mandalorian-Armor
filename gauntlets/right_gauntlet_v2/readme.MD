# Model
Model is based off of [April Storm's v4 Custom Death Watch Gauntlet](https://www.etsy.com/listing/602469685/death-watch-bo-katan-pre-vizla-and). You'd need to ask her if you wanted my modified version of the model.

# Arduino Code
This is based off of Fi-8015's [electriFi tutorial: build your own OLED display](https://mandalorianmercs.org/forum/index.php?topic=187680.0), and the related tutorial code may be found there. My addition is a really basic LED pattern generator for the acryllic panel with 8 5mm LEDs underneath.

# Fusion 360 Models
These are for the mounts that I use to house the 5mm LEDs which blink in a pattern.
